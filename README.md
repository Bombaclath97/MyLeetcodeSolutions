# Leetcode solutions I submit from time to time

Most of this stuff is poorly optimized and solely kinda sucks. That's because my only objective is to code stuff while learning some new programming languages. The following table shows what problems I did try and if I solved them or not. Thanks for getting interested. [My Leetcode profile](https://leetcode.com/Bombaclath97/).
