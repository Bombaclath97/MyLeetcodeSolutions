# Leetcode solutions I submit from time to time

Most of this stuff is poorly optimized and solely kinda sucks. That's because my only objective is to code stuff while learning some new programming languages. The following table shows what problems I did try and if I solved them or not. Thanks for getting interested. [My Leetcode profile](https://leetcode.com/Bombaclath97/).

#| Title | Difficulty | Solved | Link to problem| Notes
|-|-------|------------|-------| ---------------| -----|
1|Two Sums|Easy|Solved| [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) | Definitely can and should optimize, but it is an easy problem and i'm eager to try more advanced stuff
2|Add Two Numbers|Medium|Solved|[Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/) | Initially tried iteratively, then Jesus came on Earth and told me to use recursion. Thank you Jesus.
3| Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters | Medium | Solved (with hints - check notes) | [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/) | At first I tried iterating over the whole string while keeping the max value and beginning index. With some research I eventually found something about Sliding Windows and am currently trying with that. EDIT: Done. It works. But I didn't do this all on my own. Had various problems with the indexing and working with dictionaries (Python n00b) so researching online eventually got me to the actual answer to the problem. Sorry internet.
4|Median of Two Sorted Arrays|Hard|Not yet| [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/)|Doing it in Java cause this sounds hard ngl. Solution arrives when I study this a bit more
